Description : Shogun web, done in django.

Notes :
	- All the pages are considered as a list of articles, now all are handle in the same way in the file urls.py, but is easy to add/change urls. Each page (home,about,documentation, ... has its own template).


	- Each article has the attribtues :
		page     - main page of the navigation bar.
		subpage  - subpage of the navigation bar
		date     -
		author   -
		title    -
		content  - if you want table, links, ... you need to know html code.


	- All the admins can add an remove articles, very easy to edit the webpage.

	-http://ip:port/admin/ - access to the admin interface.
