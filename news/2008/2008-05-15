			- Experimental support for r-modular thanks to the swig team!
			- All python-modular examples describing the use of kernels,
			classifier, distributions, features, distances, regression and
			preprocessors have been ported to r-modular (requires swig from svn).
			- The 'send_command' legacy is no longer necessary, numbers can be used
			as such and don't have to be given as strings. All examples for
			r,python,octave,matlab have been converted to the new syntax.
			- Resurrected the command line interface. Basic functionionality,
			like training a classifier on strings/real valued (sparse) features
			was restored. Readline completion was added.
			- Documentation updates.
		* Bugfixes:
			- The weighted spectrum kernel is now working again.
			- Fix the testsuite to reliably check methods that use random().
			- Off-by-one bug fix in FixedDegreeStringKernel.
			- Fix reading strings from file, when strings don't have the same length.
			- Fix massive slowdown in modular interfaces for WD based kernels (it
			is 5-30 times faster now).
