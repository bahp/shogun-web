		* This release contains major feature enhancements and bugfixes:
		* Features:
			- Implement DotFeatures and CombinedDotFeatures. DotFeatures need
			  to provide dot-product and similar operations (hence the name).
			  This enables training of linear methods with mixed datatypes
			  (sparse and dense and other even the newly implemented string
			  based SpecFeatures and WDFeatures).
			- MKL now does not require CPLEX any longer.
			- Add q-norm MKL support based on internal Newton implementation.
			- Add 1-norm MKL support based on GLPK.
			- Add multiclass MKL support based on the GLPK and the GMNP svm solver.
			- Implement Tensor Product Pair Kernel (TPPK).
			- Support compilation on the iPhone :)
			- Add an option to set wds kernel position weights.
			- Build static libshogun.a for libshogun target.
			- Testsuite can also test the modular R interface, added test for
			  OligoKernel.
			- Ocas and WDOcas can be used with a bias feature now.
			- Update to LibSVM 2.88.
			- Enable parallelized HMM code by default.
		* Cleanup and API Changes:
			- Shogun has been split up into libshogun and the static and modular
			interfaces linking to it.
			- Static interfaces now do proper reference counting.
			- Remove SparseLinearClassifier: LinearClassifier is a drop-in
			  replacement.
			- WDOcas and SVMOcas now have the bias term enabled by default.
		* Bugfixes:
			- Fix regression for COMM* kernels (normalization argument was ignored).
			- Use C99 variadic macros, instead of gcc's own variant.
			- Disable lp_solve, it is not required as we are using GLPK now.
			- Fix HMM training.
