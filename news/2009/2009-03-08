		* This release contains several cleanups and bugfixes:
		* Features:
			- configure now detects libshogun/ui installed in /usr/(local/)lib if
			libshogun/ui dirs are removed.
			- Improved documentation (and path and doxygen fixes).
			- Tutorial on how to develop with libshogun and to extend shogun.
			- Added the elwms (eilergendewollmilchsau) interface that is a
			chimera that in one file interfaces to python,octave,r,matlab and
			provides the run_{octave,python,r} command to run code in
			{octave,python,r} from within octave,r,matlab,python transparently
			making variables available to the target interface avoiding file i/o.
			- Implement AttributeFeatures for (attr,value) pairs, trees etc.
		* Bugfixes:
			- fix a crasher occurring with combined kernel and multiple threads.
			- configure now allows building of modular interfaces only.
			- n-dimensional arrays work now in octave.
		* Cleanup and API Changes:
			- Custom Kernel no longer requires features nor initialization, even
			not when used in CombinedKernel (the combined kernel will skip over
			custom kernels on init).
