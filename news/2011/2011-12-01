	* SHOGUN Release version 1.1.0 (libshogun 11.0, data 0.3, parameter 0)
	* This release contains several enhancements, cleanups and bugfixes:
	* Features:
	   - New dimensionality reduction algorithms:
	     Diffusion Maps, Kernel Locally Linear Embedding,
	     Kernel Local Tangent Space Alignment, Linear Local Tangent Space Alignment,
	     Neighborhood Preserving embedding, Locality Preserving Projections.
	   - Various performance improvements for dimensionality reduction methods (BLAS,
	     alignment formulation of the LLE, ..)
	   - Automatical k determination mode for Locally Linear Embedding dimension
	     reduction method based on reconstruction error.
	   - ARPACK and SUPERLU integration.
	   - Introduce the concept of Converters that can embed (arbitrary) feature
	     types into different feature types.
	   - LibSVM is now pthread-parallelized.
	   - Create modshogun.dll for csharp.
	   - Various new c# examples (thanks Daniel Korn and Ori Cohen).
	   - Dimensionality reduction examples application is introduced
	* Bugfixes:
	   - Octave_static and octave_modular examples fix.
	   - Memory leak in custom kernel is now eliminated (thanks Madeleine Seeland for reporting).
	   - Fix for linear machine set_w method (thanks Brian Cheung for reporting).
	   - DotFeatures fix for assert bug.
	   - FibonacciHeap memory leak fix.
	   - Fix for Java modular interface typemapping bug.
	   - Fix errors uncovered by LLVM / clang++.
	   - Fix for configure on Darwin-x86_64 (thanks Peter Romov for patch).
	   - Improve lua / ruby detection.
	   - Fix configure / compilation under osx and cygwin for variuos interfaces.
	* Cleanup and API Changes:
	   - Most of the inline functions have been (re)moved to the corresponding
	     .cpp file
	   - Libshogun is now being compiled with sse support for math (if available) but
	     interfaces are now being compiled with -O0 key which drastically reduces compilation time
