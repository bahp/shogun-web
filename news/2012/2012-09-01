	* SHOGUN Release version 2.0.0 (libshogun 12.0, data 0.3, parameter 1)
	* This release also contains several enhancements, cleanups and bugfixes:
	* Features:
		- This release contains first release of Efficient Dimensionality Reduction Toolkit (EDRT).
		- Support for new SWIG -builtin python interface feature (SWIG 2.0.4 is required now).
		- EDRT algorithms are now available using static interfaces such as matlab and octave.
		- Jensen-Shannon kernel and Homogeneous kernel map preprocessor (thanks to Viktor Gal).
		- New 'multiclass' module for multiclass classification algorithms, generic linear
		  and kernel multiclass machines, multiclass LibLinear and OCAS wrappers,
		  new rejection schemes concept by Sergey Lisitsyn.
		- Mahalanobis distance, QDA, Stochastic Proximity Embedding,
		  generic OvO multiclass machine and CoverTree & KNN integation (thanks to Fernando J. Iglesias Garcia).
		- New regression estimation algorithms.
		- New graphical python modular examples.
		- Standard Cross-Validation splitting for regression problems by Heiko Strathmann
		- New data-locking concept by Heiko Strathmann which allows to tell machines that data
		  is not going to change during training/testing until unlocked.
		  KernelMachines now make use of that by not recomputing kernel matrix in cross-validation.
		- Cross-validation for KernelMachines is now parallelized.
		- Cross-validation is now possible with custom kernels.
		- Features may now have arbritarily many index subsets (of subsets (of subsets (...))).
		- Various clustering measures, Least Angle Regression and new multiclass strategies
		  concept (thanks to Chiyuan Zhang).
		- Python Sparse matrix typemap for octave modular interface (thanks to Evgeniy Andreev).
		- Newton SVM port (thanks to Harshit Syal)
		- Some progress on native windows compilation using 
		  cmake and mingw-w64 (thanks to Josh aka jklontz)
	* Bugfixes:
		- Fix for bug in the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, its domain was
		  changed to log-space.
		- Fix for R_static interface installation (thanks Steve Lianoglou).
		- SVMOcas memsetting and max_train_time bugfix.
		- Various fixes for compile errors with clang.
		- Stratified-cross-validation now used different indices for each run.
	* Cleanup and API Changes:
		- Various code cleanups by Evan Shelhamer
		- Parameter migration framework by Heiko Strathmann. From now on,
		  changes in the shogun objects will not break loading old serialized
		  files anymore
